## count_tex_expression.py
A quick, super-simplistic skim through of my thesis to answer @yosoykit's question: [what keywords did you teX most?](https://twitter.com/yosoykit/status/996870912963117056)
Spoiler: it's \mathbf. Had a lot of vectorised stuff in there.

## codenames_gameboard.R
Gameboard generator for the awesome association boardgame [Codenames](https://czechgames.com/en/codenames/).
To be used only as an extra randomiser for junkies who know them all by heart or if you happened to only have your duet set with you.

## shorten_bib_authorlist.py
A quick automated way using only built-in functions to process a .bib file for journal-specific author-list-length criteria. A quick fix in case you do not have access/desire to customise the bibliography style: it cuts the list of authors after the Nth author and substitutes "others". The original author list is lost, so always write to a new independent file.
